# TheraMind Deployment Debug

## Current Issue
- Website shows "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"
- Railway dashboard shows deployment as "successful"
- But the application is not accessible

## Possible Causes
1. Build process failure
2. Server not starting properly
3. Port binding issues
4. Railway internal routing problems

## Debug Steps
1. Check Railway deploy logs for actual startup errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test with minimal server configuration
4. Check if build artifacts are created properly

## Expected Behavior
Server should bind to Railway's PORT and respond to HTTP requests.
