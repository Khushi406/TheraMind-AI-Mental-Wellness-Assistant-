I felt powerless and worried that all my effort was going to be wasted. The frustration bubbled up quickly and was hard to shake off.\n\nTo cope, I decided to take a step back and give myself some space to breathe. I went for a walk outside and tried to focus on small things that brought me calm\u2014the sound of birds, the fresh air, and the sunlight. I also talked to a close friend about what I was feeling, which helped me feel less alone and more understood. Eventually, I reminded myself that setbacks are a normal part of growth and that I can use this as a learning experience rather than a failure.",
